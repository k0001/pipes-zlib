# Version HEAD

* BREAKING CHANGE: `compress` and `decompress` now take a `Producer ByteString`
  instead of a more polymorphic `Proxy x' x () ByteString`. This is necessary in
  order to properly support concatenated GZip archives.

* Add support for concatenated GZip archives.


* Remove version constraints from all dependencies except `base`.


# Version 0.4.4.1

* Bump upper bound dependency on `pipes`.


# Version 0.4.4

* Depend on `streaming-commons` instead of `zlib` and `zlib-bindings`,
  as the latter are deprecated.

* Add `Pipes.Zlib.decompress'` and `Pipes.GZip.decompress'`.

* Bump upper bound dependency on `transformers`.

* Add tests.


# Version 0.4.3

* Fix usage of the `Producer'` type synonym (#14).


# Version 0.4.2.1

* Fix “Codec.Compression.Zlib: premature end of compressed stream” (#13)


# Version 0.4.2

* Added the `Pipes/GZip.hs` file that was missing in 0.4.1.


# Version 0.4.1

* Added `Pipes.GZip` module.


# Version 0.4.0.1

* Bump upper bound dependency on `transformers`.


# Version 0.4.0

* Backwards incompatible API. `compress` and `decompress` are now
  functions of `Producer'`s as they need to perform actions at the
  beginning and end of input. (Issue #3)


# Version 0.3.1

* Dependency upper bounds.


# Version 0.3.0

* Upgraded to work with pipes-4.0.0, creating a new backwards
  incompatible API.

* Generalize base `IO` monad to `MonadIO`.


# Version 0.2.0.0

* New backwards incompatible API.

* Based on pipes-3.3 and zlib-bindings.


# Up to version 0.1.0

* Based on pipes-core and zlib-bindings.
